TargetProcess 3 Mashup Library
=============================

Mashups allow you to quickly extend TargetProcess 3 UI with almost any 
functionality you want. There are several places on each page 
where you can add some new UI, or you can modify the existing UI.

This repository contains some example Mashups both for immediate use 
and as starting points for developing your own Mashups.
