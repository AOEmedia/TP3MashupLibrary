Targetprocess 3 Mashup Library
=============================

Mashups allow you to quickly extend Targetprocess 3 UI with almost any functionality you want. You can use existing mashups or create your own and share them with other Targetprocess users via Targetprocess Mashup Library.

[TP3MashupLibrary](https://github.com/TargetProcess/TP3MashupLibrary) repository contains all the mashups which are available for Targetprocess 3 users in Mashup Library. However to share your own mashup please upload it to [TP3MashupSandbox](https://github.com/TargetProcess/TP3MashupSandbox) repository. We’ll verify it and make it public.

Thanks a lot for your input! We are sure that your mashup will be very useful for other Targetprocess users!
