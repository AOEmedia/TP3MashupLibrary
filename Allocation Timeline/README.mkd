People Allocations on Projects Timeline by Months
=======================

This mashup works from __v.2.23.1__. Make sure that you fill Start and End dates for people in project Teams ```Settings > (Project Settings) > Teams```. Allocation for project will not be visible if there is no End Date specified for a person.

Navigate to ```Reports > (People) > People\Projects Timeline``` to see the report.

This mashup shows in a visual way what projects people are working on, when they started and when they are going to leave projects. Future allocations are shown as well.
